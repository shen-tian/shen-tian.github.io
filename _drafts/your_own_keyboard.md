title: Customising your own keyboard
---

Interesting notes:

 - Right hand is where the complicated stuff happens, as the Qwerty keyboard is quite optimised toward the left.
 - Corners are for palming.
 - Interesting alternative modes: double up modifiers and single function (e.g. space cadet)
 - Switching between your snowflake keyboard and a normal one.
 - Ortholinear bottom left hand alignment
 - Why?
