## Ortholinear keyboards

Not entirely convinced it's better by any definition, not sure the stagger is a problem that needs solving. Looking for symmetry in this is kind of futile.

But, more thumb keys are really good. That, along with customisations is the main advantage of Preonic.

## TKL, 60%, 40%

They are handy to have, if nothing else, means you don't need to remember the symbols which aren't very commonly used. There's probably something in there about the value of a 40% keyboard: why? Forces you to concentrate everything in an area where there's no repositioning. Ususal TKL definitely has areas where you are supposed to reposition.

If we go down to 60, mostly not, except for keys on the right.

## Mobility

Then, there's something in there about which keys are easier to press, and which ones aren't. Can use the OLKB diagram as starting point.

There's something in there about the greater mobility you get when you are using thumb for a modifier: pivot from there. Whereas pinky modifiers do limit where you go. Thus, kind of works for shift if you use oposite hands. Otherwise a bit limited to how you work keys.

Interesting notes:

 - Right hand is where the complicated stuff happens, as the Qwerty keyboard is quite optimised toward the left.
 - Corners are for palming.
 - Interesting alternative modes: double up modifiers and single function (e.g. space cadet)
 - Switching between your snowflake keyboard and a normal one.
 - Ortholinear bottom left hand alignment
 - Why?
