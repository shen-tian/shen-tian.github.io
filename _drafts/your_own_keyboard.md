## Non staggered keyboards

Most keyboards have the typewritter stagger, which allowed levers inside mechanical typewriters to not interfere with each other. Needless to say, this is a bit of an anarchronism, but opions vary on how much of a problem this introduces. There's a couple of contemporary keyboard designs that does away with this. This includes the [ErgoDox][ergodox], [Atreus][atreus], and various [Ortholinear Keyboards][olkb].

The Preonic I ended up with is from OLKB. I found the adaptation to the non-stagger fairly easy, except for one area: re-learning which fingers I use to press the `X` and `C` keys. Turns out that like many people, I've been using my index finger for `C` and middle finger for `X`. This adaptation does mean I occationally mistype these keys on a normal keyboard, but doesn't present a major issue.

Overall, I'm not convinced that having aligned columns is better or worse than the standard keyboard layout. It's simply slightly different. It's conceptually (and physically) neat, but I don't believe the typewriter stagger presents any actual problems. Ultimatley, there's a limited amount of symmetry in how we use our hands: almost everyone favours one hand over the other, after all, maybe the stagger is just one of those arbitary asymetries.

## Full size, TKL, 60%, or 40%

A "full size" keyboard has just over 100 keys. We can often get by on fewer keys:

- The numberpad mostly duplicates keys that's elsewhere on the keyboard already. Unless you are doing a lot of number entry, there's not a lot of loss of functionality when you lose it to go to a **T**en **K**ey**L**ess layout.

- Some operating systems don't make a lot of us of the document navigation keys (Page Up, Insert etc.) and functions keys (F1, F2, ...). In particular, macOS does not lean on these heavily, as reflected in these keys being either absent or behind a function layer on most Apple keyboards. Losing these keys takes us down to a 60% keyboard (typically having around 60 keys)

- Some keyboards go more spartan, but removing the number row and a couple of other keys. These are typically classified as 40% keyboards.

Overall, I settled on the 60% Preonic. I like that it's close to beign the largest keyboard you can use without requiring you to significantly reposition your hands to reach any of the keys. Compared to 40% keyboards, it's really handy to not have to retrain yourself to find the number row (and all the symbols on it) on a function layer.

## Hand mobility and flexibility

Then, there's something in there about which keys are easier to press, and which ones aren't. Can use the OLKB diagram as starting point.

There's something in there about the greater mobility you get when you are using thumb for a modifier: pivot from there. Whereas pinky modifiers do limit where you go. Thus, kind of works for shift if you use oposite hands. Otherwise a bit limited to how you work keys.

## Interesting notes:

 - Right hand is where the complicated stuff happens, as the Qwerty keyboard is quite optimised toward the left.
 - Corners are for palming.
 - Why?
